/* Story
 * The trees that conceived yesternight our Dear Fire from which
 * comes our Light (by which all in our land move, live, and
 * have breath--our most important resource) have abruptly been
 * no more. Unknown is the cause of this dread our land Arbre
 * now beholds. Some rumours say that our enemy, the Night, is at wake;
 * others still, say the world has met its bitter ends. Yet, even
 * amidst this vast darkness that extends from the edge of our land over
 * yonder and beyond, our hearts tell us that there is still a hope;
 * and though deeply distressed am I to wake each dawn to the surrounding
 * infinite darkness, devoid of our Dear Fire, oddly the Light shining
 * watching us from yonder stars, it I can still see. Much to carry is
 * the burden, and fearful is the thought that our people may not
 * embrace the warmth and beauty of our Dear Fire ever again. The suddenness
 * with which our foes have struck, doubtful it is that there is any
 * other cause of our being shaken. Even my dearest wife Arlayna, who comes
 * fond of knowledge and can willfully invoke it at her fingertips, knows
 * not of our enemy's whereabouts, or even who our enemy is. Thus, even
 * as outnumbered as be we might, I, Arbane IX of Leirmat, am left
 * to but one option as the Vanguard of Arbre: send our three
 * greatest Knights to oppose the Night face-to-face to the end
 * in order to restore the great Light which from us was robbed. Today, I send:
 * Knight Light into Night.
 *
 *
 * - Vanguard Arbane IX and his wife, Vanguardress Arlayna II

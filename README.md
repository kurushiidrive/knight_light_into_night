# knight_light_into_night
Console window dungeon battle game in c++

The combat uses the d20 system and consists of three classes of weapons each with varying game statistics based on survivability, damage, and accuracy. The only working and running version at the moment is the lone file called main.cpp (not inside the folder called oop-version). The files in the oop-version folder reflect my current progress in using what I have learnt in my second introductory computer science course in college in order to better organise the game.

In short, the "short" version works but does not have as much depth, whereas the oop-version is work in progress and currently does not consistently work across all compilers (due to some limitations on portability of the thread library, which still isn't standard C++).
